Client has to introduce their problem to you and this process is named <strong>briefing</strong>. It may be a meeting or in written form.</p><p>The first and crucial step is to <strong>understand the problem</strong>. It is particulary important when we work with a new client.</p><div class="important"><p>Once we understand client&#39;s problems, only then can we offer a solution. Never before.</p></div><p>But it may happen, that even your client doesn&#39;t always exactly know, what the problem is or how to communicate it.</p><p>Here are <strong>some key points</strong> that may help us to ask the right questions <strong>to analyze the problem and start to work towards finding a solution.</strong> We have to be sure, that we have the competence/time/resources to achieve client&#39;s goals. If this is not sure from the initial brief, then we should ask them.</p><h2 id="‚ùì-questions-to-ask"><a class="header-anchor" href="#‚ùì-questions-to-ask" aria-hidden="true">#</a> <span class="emojicon">‚ùì</span> Questions to ask</h2><ul><li>who is our <strong>main contact</strong> at client&#39;s side - it may sound silly, but sometimes it is not obvious</li><li>what is <strong>the problem</strong> we are solving - can we put it in <strong>one sentence</strong>?</li><li>what are <strong>our goals</strong> - what should be <strong>different</strong> after this project?</li><li>target <strong>audience</strong></li><li>what <strong>have been done before</strong> - branding, previous projects, research etc</li><li><strong>competitors</strong> - what others are doing</li><li>the <strong>budget</strong></li><li><strong>deadline</strong></li><li>other (partners, law (copyright), restrictions, cultural and other possibly important aspects)</li></ul><p>That was just a short list, more thorough articles can be found here:</p><ul><li><a href="https://uxdesign.cc/40-questions-ux-designers-must-ask-when-starting-on-a-project-or-meeting-a-client-for-the-first-7368b875bae" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Questions UX Designers must ask when starting on a project</a></li><li><a href="https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2021/03/9-questions-to-ask-businesses-before-taking-on-a-project.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9 Questions to Ask Businesses Before Taking on a Project</a></li><li><a href="https://99designs.com/blog/tips/questions-to-ask-your-client/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20 questions to ask your client before any design project</a></li></ul><h2 id="design-proposal"><a class="header-anchor" href="#design-proposal" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Design proposal</h2><p>Sometimes you have to compete for the job and then you have to deliver a <strong>design proposal</strong>. <a href="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/how-ux-ui-designers-should-write-a-design-proposal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is an article</a>, about how to write one.</p><h2 id="pricing"><a class="header-anchor" href="#pricing" aria-hidden="true">#</a> Pricing</h2><p>This is often the hardest part, because both - your client and yourself - should be happy at the end of the project.
