# What is html?

HTML aka Hypertext Markup Language is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web pages.

# History

HTML was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. The idea was to exchange documents via the internet between CERN researchers.

Since not many web developers were involved HTML didn’t grow very much. But because internet was getting rather popular a HTML working group was created to develop a new standard. This standard was called HTML 2.0.

Since 1996 the HTML specifications have been maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

In 1999 HTML4 was published and was the main spec for webpages for almost 15 years. 

In October 2014 HTML5 was finalized and this is the version that is used today for building websites and the one that we will be learning in this course.
