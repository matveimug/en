## ✋ Before we start

Should we talk a bit about the [Erasmus Edesign project](https://e-disain.eu/en/) here? Or at least mention, that these materials are part of the project. Ok, now I mentioned it. Good.

## Overview

- Right now here is one Module of the whole Interactive Graphics Curriculum.
- From the top menu ☝ you'll find 4 learning outcomes or big Chapters of the module:
    1. **Introduction** to the subject
    2. **FrontEnd** developement basics
    3. UI/UX **design basics**
    4. Creating **graphics**
- Once inside any of the 4 Chapters, you'll find Topics and Subtopics of the chapter from the 👈 left sidebar.
